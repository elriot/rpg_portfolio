## Welcome to My RPG Portfolio



### Overview

- **Inspiration**: This portfolio is crafted with love and nostalgia, taking inspiration from the RPG games I used to play during my childhood.

- **Platform Compatibility**: Please note that this portfolio is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile optimization is currently not available.



### Features

- **Character Movement and Rooms**: The portfolio consists of three rooms: the starting room, the portfolio room, and the profile room. Move through these rooms using your keyboard. All visible objects are interactiveâ€”press the 'Enter' or 'Spacebar' key to trigger dialog bubbles and gather more information.

- **Tech Stack**: Developed using React, the project is highly modular, breaking down the necessary components and conditionally rendering images based on various states.

- **Styling**: Initially, I used the Tailwind CSS library to some extent, but most of the application's styling is written in classic CSS. This was an experimental effort to overcome challenges I faced with frontend development and layout design.

- **Additional Features**: Turn the BGM on or off at your convenience. A clickable keyboard button is also available, and its visibility can be toggled as you please.



### Conclusion

Please enjoy navigating through my unique portfolio. It's not just a display of my skills but also a fun, interactive experience that I hope you'll enjoy.
